## 2024-05-22 - Missing Mobile Navigation
**Learning:** The dashboard becomes completely unusable on mobile devices because the `Sidebar` component is hidden (`hidden md:flex`) and no alternative mobile menu (e.g., hamburger menu, bottom nav) is implemented. This is a critical responsive design failure.
**Action:** In future tasks, prioritize implementing a responsive navigation solution (e.g., a collapsible sidebar or bottom navigation bar) to ensure mobile accessibility.
